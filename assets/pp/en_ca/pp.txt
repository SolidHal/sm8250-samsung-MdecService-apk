Our Services may link to third party websites and services that are outside our control. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by websites or other services. You should exercise caution and review the privacy statements applicable to the third party websites and services you use.
We also may make available to you certain products or services (e.g. apps available through Galaxy Apps or Apps) developed by third parties. Samsung is not responsible for these third party products or services.

These third parties may collect or receive certain information about your use of the Services, including through the use of cookies, beacons, and similar technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected across different websites and online services. Samsung does not control the data collection and use practices of these companies.

COOKIES, BEACONS, AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
We, as well as certain third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, beacons, and other technologies in certain areas of our Services.

Cookies
Cookies are small files that store information on your computer, TV, mobile phone, or other device. They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize you across different websites, services, devices, and/or browsing sessions. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:
• Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you don’t have to enter those credentials each time you log on to a service.
• Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they are spending on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt the Services and provide you with a better experience.
• Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don’t receive the same ad each time you access a Service.
• Cookies help us and third parties provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information about your use of our Services and other websites and apps.
When you use a web browser to access the Services, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. The operating system of your device may contain additional controls for cookies.
Please note, however, that some Services may be designed to work using cookies and that disabling cookies may affect your ability to use those Services, or certain parts of them.

Other Local Storage
We, along with certain third parties, may use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies, please click here “http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html”.

Beacons
We, along with certain third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or “pixels”) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We and certain third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.
By accessing and using our Services, you consent to the storage of cookies, other local storage technologies, beacons, and other information on your devices. You also consent to the access of such cookies, local storage technologies, beacons, and information by us and by the third parties mentioned above.

PRIVACY NOTICE FOR CUSTOMIZATION SERVICE
To use the Customization Service, you must first have a Samsung account. Our Privacy Policy at https://account.samsung.com/membership/pp (“Samsung Privacy Policy”) will apply to your use of your Samsung account and the Customization Service. This Privacy Notice provides additional details about how your personal information may be collected, used, shared, and stored in connection with the Customization Service, and should be read together with the Samsung Privacy Policy. In case of any inconsistency or conflict between the terms of this Privacy Notice and the Samsung Privacy Policy, the terms of this Privacy Notice shall prevail.

What is the Customization Service?
Samsung devices, apps, and services (each a “Service” and collectively, the “Services”) are designed to provide you with customized services by predicting your desires and needs in a smart and intelligent manner. Samsung’s Customization Service provides an enhanced user experience, including customized content and recommendations, based on the information obtained about you and your use of the Services. For example, the Customization Service can improve your user experience with the Services by offering hints and information customized for you when you use Samsung’s voice recognition service, or remembering music you used to listen to on rainy days and recommending it later. Furthermore, if you give the command, “Remind me to buy a bottle of water when I am almost home,” the Customization Service can remember the command and remind you to purchase a bottle of water when you are almost home.

What types of information may the Customization Service collect about you?
The more the Customization Service understands and learns about you, the faster and more accurately it can provide you with customized content and information. The Customization Service is designed to help understand your interests, preferences, and location, and collects and analyzes information about you in various ways, including:
• Device Information. The Customization Service may collect your device’s unique identification information, settings information (such as language and lock settings), status information (such as connections with other devices), and other information about your devices. The Customization Service also may check the applications installed or currently running on your device. In addition, the Customization Service may collect information about how, when, and for how long you use the devices connected to your Samsung account, including your usage of the Services and third party apps and services on the devices (such as a list of apps on your devices, music played on your devices, the websites you visit, and the searches you make).
• Information about Your Music and Photos. The Customization Service may collect and analyze information such as titles, genres, and artists on previously played or saved music and information about your photos, such as the times and locations at which your saved photos were taken.
• Contacts and Communications Data. The Customization Service may access your contact list and may collect and analyze your incoming/outgoing call and text message history to provide you with services, such as to determine your relationships with others (e.g. your family and friends), who your most important contacts are, who contacts you most frequently, and your preferred contact method; to display information about your important contacts (e.g. missed calls); and to find contacts you refer to while using voice recognition.
• Calendar Information. The Customization Service may access your device’s calendar and may collect and analyze your calendar data to learn your preferences, record special occasions, and identify your location.
• Internet Browsing History. The Customization Service may access, collect, and analyze your Internet browsing history (such as visited websites, search keywords, and bookmarks) to learn your interests and preferences; to display more relevant search results and provide the most appropriate information in different contexts; and to provide you with other services, as described in this Privacy Notice. Your search history from Internet browsing done in Secret mode (Incognito or Private mode) will not be collected.
• Location Information. The Customization Service may access, collect, and analyze your device’s precise geolocation and other information related to your location on a regular basis through Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals, calendar entries, and other technologies and data for certain purposes, such as to provide location-related notifications or information you request. In order for the Customization Service to collect geolocation information, the Location settings must be enabled on your device. Therefore, in some cases, the Customization Service may request that you enable the Location settings.
• Samsung account, My Profile, and Samsung Services Data. The Customization Service may collect and analyze information stored in or associated with your Samsung account (such as your Samsung account ID, contact information, name, date of birth, and gender) and information registered in your My profile. The Customization Service also may collect and analyze information related to your use of the Services, such as your usage history of Samsung apps, your voice commands given via the voice recognition service, notifications set in Reminder, and weather data provided to you.
• Information Related to Connected Third Party Apps and Services. By permitting the connection to a third party app or service, you can enable the Customization Service to utilize the data regarding your usage of these third party apps and services and to provide you with customized features.

Apart from the information specified above, the Customization Service may also collect information about you, your devices and apps, and your use of the Services in ways that we describe to you at the time of collection or otherwise with your consent. The Customization Service provides you with choices regarding how the Customization Service may use and analyze certain types of personal information, such as your call and text message history, geolocation data, and internet browsing history. The Customization Service also provides you with the choice to opt out of the Customization Service’s use of your personal information for advertising purposes. For more information, please see the “Your Rights and Choices” section, below.

How is the collected information used?
The Customization Service will analyze the information specified above through an automated system, and provide the analyzed data to the Services and third party apps you authorized for the following purposes:
• to provide you with customized content and information;
• to analyze methods of providing you with better Services;
• to improve and develop the Services;
• to display customized advertisements about products and services that may be of interest to you; and
• with your separate consent, to communicate with you via email and push notification about products and services offered by Samsung and third parties that are tailored to your interests.
You can stop the collection and use of certain information as described in the “Your Rights and Choices” section, below. Please note that, as certain information is necessary for each of the Services to provide you with the Customization Service, the optimum user experience can only be ensured when you permit the Customization Service access to all information.

Customized Advertising and Direct Marketing
The Customization Service may collect, analyze, and share information about your use of the Services and online activities, over time and across third party websites and apps, as well as across devices, to provide you with advertising and direct marketing communications (collectively, “Ads”) about products and services offered by Samsung and third parties that are tailored to your interests. Where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent for the processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes. You may opt out of the Customization Service’s use of this information for customized Ads via the My profile > Manage Samsung account menu in your Samsung account settings, by turning off “Advertisement Using Customization Service”. Please note that disabling this option may not stop all of the Ads (including customized Ads) provided by Samsung. You may continue to receive Ads from Samsung if you have consented to receiving them from other Services. Please visit the Settings menu in the applicable Service for more information on how to opt out of such Ads from other Services.

How can I delete information obtained by the Customization Service?
Information collected and analyzed by the Customization Service will be deleted after you delete your Samsung account. You also may request the deletion of specific categories of data that have been collected and analyzed by the Customization Service at any time, even before deleting your Samsung account, via the Privacy Settings menu in your Samsung account. Please note that, in some cases, it may take some time before the information saved on our servers is completely deleted.

What happens if I delete information collected by the Customization Service or stop the Customization Service’s collection of some of the information?
If you delete collected information, the accuracy and/or quality of the customized content delivered to you by the Customization Service may decrease. Moreover, some customization features may require information that you have deleted or to which you have denied the Customization Service access, and it may only be possible to resume receiving those features by allowing the Customization Service to collect and use the relevant information again.

To whom do we disclose your personal information?
We do not disclose personal information about you to third parties through the Customization Service, except as described in this Privacy Notice and the Samsung Privacy Policy. We may share your personal information with our subsidiaries and affiliates and with third party service providers who help us to provide the Customization Service.

How We Protect Your Personal Information
We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information we obtain through the Services and the Customization Service against unlawful or unauthorized destruction, interference, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use.

Your Rights and Choices
Samsung respects the choices made by you and strives to offer a variety of ways for you to control your information. You may, at any time, disable the Customization Service via the “Customization Service” option in the Settings menu of your Samsung account, in which case Samsung will suspend the provision of customized content and information, as well as the Customization Service’s collection and analysis of your information. In addition, if you change the settings described in the “Customized Advertising and Direct Marketing” section, above, information collected and analyzed by the Customization Service may no longer be utilized for advertisement purposes.

Furthermore, you can specify the categories of information that the Customization Service may collect and analyze, as well as the Customization Service’s support for certain Services. However, any subsequent decisions will not affect the information already collected and analyzed by the Customization Service, and disabling the Customization Service will not cause information previously collected and analyzed by the Customization Service to be deleted.

The specific settings above may be subject to change with updated or new device models supporting the Customization Service. Please note that your customized user experience may change as a result of disabling the Customization Service.

You may be entitled, in accordance with applicable law, to object to or request restriction of the processing of your personal information, and to request access to and rectification of your own personal information.

SAMSUNG GLOBAL PRIVACY POLICY – SMART TV SUPPLEMENT
Samsung’s Smart TV service offers a set of features that provide enhanced video content, customized TV experiences, movies, connections to social networking services, and the ability to control and interact with your Smart TV with voice commands. We collect, use, share, and store information through your Smart TV and the devices connected with your Smart TV in the ways described in the Samsung Global Privacy Policy. This Supplement provides additional details about the privacy practices of some Smart TV features.

The Smart TV is designed to enable you to easily find and access video programming and other content. For example, you may access information about live television programs distributed to you by your cable or satellite operator and on-demand video content offerings distributed by third party content providers through searchable guides displayed on your Smart TV.
In the case of live television programs, we determine what content is available to you based in part on your postal code. In addition, the Smart TV helps you find and experience other Smart TV content more relevant to you by highlighting programming and content that is likely to interest you or providing additional services that will enhance your viewing experience. We base these recommendations and additional services on:
• Information about content that you have watched, purchased, downloaded, or streamed through Samsung applications on your Smart TV or other devices (About the TV viewing information please see ‘Viewing Information Services’ section below);
• Information about applications you have accessed through the Smart TV;
• Information about your clicks on the “Like”, “Dislike”, “Watch Now”, and other buttons on your Smart TV;
• The query terms you enter into Smart TV search features, including when you search for particular video content;
• Other Smart TV usage and device information, including, but not limited to, IP address, log data, information that identifies your hardware or software configuration, browser information, and the page(s) you request.

Viewing Information Services
In order to provide you with customized and personalized Smart TV experiences, some of our feature and services will rely on your TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information.
Your TV viewing history includes information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programs viewed on your Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them.
We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture this information. Your Smart TV transfers video snippets or TV tuner information in order to determine the programs watched.
You may change your privacy choice at any time by going to the settings menu to disable the particular feature or service at your sole discretion, in which case your TV viewing history will cease to be collected for that particular feature or service.
Bear in mind, that your privacy choice may affect the availability or quality of the specific viewing information based service.

Interest-Based Advertisement Services
The Interest-Based Advertisement Services (the “IBA Services”) is designed to provide the ability to obtain and view useful, interactive, and interest-based advertisements about products and services offered by Samsung and third parties on your Samsung Smart TV or across various Samsung and third party platforms or devices, including linear commercials, on the web, mobile devices, and tablets.

In order to make the advertising on your devices more relevant to you, the IBA service will rely on your TV viewing history (including information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programs viewed on your Samsung Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them), Samsung Smart TV usage information, and other statistical data obtained from trusted third party data sources. We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture your TV viewing history.

Based on the information above we create groups of Samsung Smart TV owners who share similar interests and use these groups for the IBA Service. The information above is used to determine the groups to which your Samsung Smart TV is assigned and thus, which advertisements your devices receive.

You may disable the IBA Service at any time by visiting the Settings menu on your Samsung Smart TV.

Please note that your privacy choice with respect to the IBA Service will not affect whether or not you receive or are served with other types of ads and marketing that are not specifically based on your TV viewing history or Samsung Smart TV usage information. Those other types of ads and marketing will be based on other information such as generalized location, and other estimated or inferred information. They might be less relevant because they are not based on your interests.

For more detailed information about the IBA Services, please refer to the IBA Services Privacy Notice at the bottom of this Supplement.

PSID
Your Smart TV viewing history and usage information collected for the purposes of providing interest-based advertisements will be linked to a randomized, non-persistent, and resettable device identifier called the Personalized Service ID or “PSID.”
You may reset your PSID at any time by visiting the Settings menu on your Smart TV and, once reset, your Smart TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information with respect to interest-based advertisements will be de-linked from its previous PSID. Bear in mind that if you reset your PSID, the quality of customized and interest-based advertisements may not be fine-tuned.

Voice Recognition
You can control your Smart TV, and use many of its features, with voice commands.
If you enable Voice Recognition, you can interact with your Smart TV using your voice. To provide the Voice Recognition feature, your voice commands will be transmitted (along with information about your device, including device identifiers) to us and we will convert your voice commands into text to provide the Voice Recognition features. In addition, Samsung may collect voice commands and associated texts so that we can evaluate and improve the features. Samsung will collect your voice commands only when you make a specific search request to the Smart TV by clicking the activation button either on the remote control or on your screen and speaking into the microphone on the remote control.
If you do not enable Voice Recognition, you will not be able to use the voice recognition features.
You may disable Voice Recognition data collection at any time by visiting the Settings menu. However, this would prevent you from using the Voice Recognition features.

For more detail information about the Voice Recognition, please refer to the Voice Recognition Privacy Notice at the bottom of this Supplement.

Third Parties
Please note that when you watch a video or access applications or content provided by a third party, that provider may collect or receive information about your Smart TV (e.g. its IP address and device identifiers), the requested transaction (e.g. your request to buy or rent the video), and your use of the application or service. Samsung is not responsible for these providers’ privacy or security practices. You should exercise caution and review the privacy statements applicable to the third party websites and services you use.

Country-Specific Features
Please note that one or more of the features described in this Smart TV Supplement may not be available to you depending on where you live.

This Supplement provides additional details about how we use that information to provide our Mobile Device features.

The Samsung Health application, connected applications, and associated accessories (collectively “Samsung Health”) is an all-in-one companion designed to encourage a healthy lifestyle. With Samsung Health, you can track your everyday activities; get coaching to reach your daily fitness goals and milestones; and measure and manage factors such as your heart rate, SpO2 levels, and stress level.
The purpose of processing data for Samsung Health is to provide the service or feature that you request, including data back-up and sync services for Samsung account users, to provide data analysis and statistics to enhance your wellness and to improve Samsung Health itself and its offerings. Data can be collected either through sensors on your Mobile Device or when you actually enter your own data into the applicable Mobile Device or related application or accessory.
Further information on the way we process your information is described in the Samsung Health Privacy Notice, viewable in the Settings menu of the Samsung Health application.

Samsung Social
Samsung Social (formerly named Enhanced Features) is a bundled set of services designed to simplify and improve the ways in which you can share and connect with your friends.
With the currently available features for example, you can share your profile and view images from your friends; and easily share files and content with your friends in Contact.
To provide these features, we will need to collect your name, phone number information from your contacts list, and access to content you are about to share with your friends.
You have the choice to disable these features in its entirety, or in the alternative, you can pick and choose which of the services you wish to use, by visiting your Samsung account Settings in your Mobile Device or the applications which use Samsung Social features.
In addition, based on how you choose to use Samsung Social, you can choose what categories of data you will share, as well as which friends to share with.

Samsung Pay
Samsung Pay is an easy and safe way to make debit and credit card purchases using your compatible Mobile Device. To use Samsung Pay and initiate the card registration process, identification and verification data will be submitted to your bank from your Mobile Device. This includes Samsung account information and Samsung Pay usage data, device information, location information (i.e. where you are when you register your card) if the Location settings are enabled, and card information and billing address, which is sent to your card issuer, passing through our servers. This information is encrypted by your Mobile Device and sent to your bank over Samsung servers. We never access any card or bank details.
Once your Mobile Device has been enrolled, all transaction data is transmitted securely between your Mobile Device and your issuer and bank. Recent transaction history is available on your Mobile Device and is known only to you, your bank, and card issuer. We do not collect any information on the transactions you make or the device or account used to make transactions. We may, however, aggregate and anonymise information collected regarding your attempts to make purchases using Samsung Pay to understand the way people use Samsung Pay so that we can improve it by making it more convenient and useful for our customers.
Further information on the way we process your information is described in the Samsung Pay Privacy Notice, viewable in the Settings menu of the Samsung Pay application.

Voice Services
You can control your Mobile Device and use many of its features, with voice commands.
Depending on your model and region you can command your Mobile Device to activate certain features such as playing songs from playlist or perform web searches using S Voice. Further, you can control everything you’ve done with touch interface using your voice command with Bixby. You can also receive language translation support through S Translator, dictate memos through Voice Memo or activate features while driving by speaking to your Mobile Device after enabling Car Mode.
To provide the Voice Services, some voice commands may be transmitted (along with information about your device and its usage, including device identifiers) to a third party service provider that converts your voice commands to text. In addition, Samsung may collect and your device may capture voice commands and associated texts so that we can provide you with Voice Services and evaluate and improve the features.

Samsung Advertising ID
In order to make the content and advertising on your Mobile Device more relevant to you, we will collect information about your usage of your Mobile Device and services.
Information about your Mobile Device usage that is collected for the purposes of providing customized marketing will be linked to a randomized, non-persistent and resettable device identifier called the Samsung advertising ID. You may reset your Samsung advertising ID at any time via the Settings menu on your Mobile Device and your previous usage information with respect to customized marketing will be de-linked and separated from what is collected under the new Samsung advertising ID. However, if you reset your Samsung advertising ID, the customized marketing may not be best aligned to your personal interests. You may also opt out from receiving customized marketing at any time via the Settings menu in the applicable Samsung service application on your Mobile Device.
However, even if you opt out from receiving customized marketing, it will not affect whether or not you receive other types of ads and marketing on your Mobile Devices. The only difference will be that those ads will not be based on the usage information of your Mobile Device.
Please also bear in mind that Samsung may still collect information about your usage of your Mobile Device for other purposes as described in the main body of this Privacy Policy.
