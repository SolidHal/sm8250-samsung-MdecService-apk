Call & Message Continuity Privacy Notice

Effective Date: 30/03/2018

Samsung Electronics (UK) Limited (“Samsung” or “We”) and its affiliated companies respect your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Notice applies to the personal information we collect through the Call & Message Continuity service (the “Service”). It does not apply to information collected by other apps, websites, or services provided by Samsung or its affiliated entities.

The Service is a multi-device communication service. Its features include incoming and outgoing call relay, call and message history, and message synchronisation between your primary device (e.g. your smartphone) and secondary device(s) (e.g. your watch, tablet, laptop, etc.) so that you are able to receive incoming calls and read messages on your secondary device(s) and make outgoing calls and send new messages using your primary device.

To use the Service, you must first sign in to a Samsung account on both your primary device and your secondary device(s). And if your secondary device is a watch, you must set up a network service by subscribing to a mobile data plan via the system provided by your service provider that allows you to use your watch with your normal phone number. If your secondary device is a tablet that only supports data, you must set up a connection with a Wi-Fi network or with the system provided by your service provider that allows you to use your tablet. Our Privacy Policy at https://account.samsung.com/membership/pp (“Samsung Privacy Policy”) will apply to your use of your Samsung account and Call & Message Continuity. This Privacy Notice provides further information about how your personal data is used in connection with the Service, and should be read in conjunction with the Samsung Privacy Policy.

In this Privacy Notice, we describe the types of information collected through the Service, how we may use the information, how long we may keep the information, with whom we may share it, and the choices available to you regarding our use of the information and exercising your rights. We also describe the measures we take to safeguard the information and tell you how to contact us about our privacy practices. Samsung is the data controller for the processing of personal data.

Information We Obtain

Through the Service, we obtain information about you in various ways. The types of personal information we obtain include:

•	Samsung account Information. We collect information associated with your Samsung account used to access the Service, such as your Samsung account ID.

•	The Service Interactions. We collect information you exchange through your interactions with the Service, including information regarding callers and recipients, information regarding message senders and recipients, the content of messages you send and receive, and your call and message history on smartphone applications. Additionally, other usage information, such as your touch interactions and other input, and the information you receive from the Service (such as responses and answers) will also be collected. If you submit information to the Service that is sensitive in nature (i.e. health information), such as messages you send or receive that contain sensitive information, that will also be collected and processed for the purposes set out below. We will not actively collect such information without first obtaining your separate explicit consent or as provided for by applicable law.

•	Device and App Information. We collect information through automated means about your Service-enabled devices, such as the mobile number, network MAC address, device identifiers, and other unique identifiers.

How We Use the Information We Obtain
We use the information we obtain through the Service to:

•	identify and authenticate you so you may use a certain service;
•	provide you with the Service, such as incoming and outgoing calls relayed between your devices and synchronisation of your call history and messages on your devices (smartphone, watch, tablet, laptop, etc.);
•	improve and customise your experience with the Service;
•	respond to your requests and enquiries;
•	operate, evaluate, and improve our business (including developing new products; enhancing and improving our products and services; managing our communications; analysing our products, customer base, and services; conducting market research; performing data analytics; and performing accounting, auditing, and other internal functions);
•	allow you to interact with and use certain third party apps and services;
•	protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other criminal activity, claims, and other liabilities; and
•	comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards, and our policies, including this Privacy Notice, and the Samsung Privacy Policy.

Through the Service, we may collect personal information about your online activities on the Service-enabled devices over time and across apps related to smartphone call and message services. We may use third party analytics services on the Service. The providers that administer these analytics services help us analyse your use of the Service and improve the Service. The information we obtain may be disclosed to or collected directly by these providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the Service, help provide the Service, and diagnose technical issues.


Samsung processes personal data for the purposes described above. Samsung’s legal basis to process personal data includes processing that is: necessary for the performance of the contract between you and Samsung (for example, to provide you with the Service and to identify and authenticate you so that you may use a certain service); necessary to comply with legal requirements (for example, to comply with applicable accounting rules and to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement); necessary for Samsung’s legitimate interests (for example, to manage our relationship with you and to improve the Service); and based on obtaining your separate consent (for example, to communicate with you about our products and services and provide you with marketing information), which may subsequently be withdrawn at any time by contacting us as specified in the How to Contact Us section of this Privacy Notice without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

You are required, as a necessity to enter into a contract, to provide us with personal data for processing as described above. If you do not provide us with personal data, we will not be able to provide you with all of the features available through the Service.

Information Sharing

We do not disclose personal information about you through the Service, except as described in this Privacy Notice. Limited members of the Service team in Samsung may access and otherwise process personal data in connection with their job responsibilities or contractual obligations. We may share your personal information with our subsidiaries and affiliates and with service providers who perform services for us. We do not authorise our service providers to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements.

Some of these personnel, affiliates, and third party service providers are located outside of the EEA, including in countries that may not provide the same level of data protection as the home country of our customers, including, for example and without limitation to, the Republic of Korea, the United States of America, and Japan. Samsung takes appropriate steps to ensure that such recipients are bound to duties of confidentiality and Samsung implements measures such as standard data protection contractual clauses to ensure that any transferred personal data remains protected and secure. A copy of these clauses can be obtained by contacting us as specified in the How to Contact Us section of this Privacy Notice.

Samsung, our subsidiaries and affiliates, and our third party service providers also may disclose information about you (1) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena); (2) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities; (3) to establish, exercise, or defend our legal rights; (4) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical or other harm or financial loss; (5) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; (6) in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a merger, acquisition, sale, transfer, reorganisation, dissolution, or liquidation); or (7) otherwise with your separate consent.


Retention of Personal Data

We take appropriate steps to ensure that information about you is only retained based on the following logic:
1. at least the duration for which the information is used to provide you with the Service;
2. as required under law, a contract, or with regard to our statutory obligations; or
3. only for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, is processed, or longer if required under any contract, by applicable law, or for statistical purposes, subject to appropriate safeguards.

Your Choices

We offer you certain choices in connection with the personal information we obtain about you. To update your preferences, limit the communications you receive from us, or submit a request, please contact us as specified in the How to Contact Us section of this Privacy Notice.

Please visit the “Remote Connection” settings on your device for choices that may be available to you in connection with your use of the Service. Please note that if you decline to allow the Service, you may not be able to use all of the features available through the Service.

Your Rights

You have the right to request details about the information we collect about you and to request us to correct inaccuracies in that information, to object to or request the restriction of processing, and to request access to, the erasure, or portability of your information. Under the laws of some jurisdictions, we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardise the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. If you would like to make a request to access your information, please contact us by visiting our Privacy Support page (https://www.samsung.com/request-desk).

If you request deletion of personal information, you acknowledge that you may not be able to access or use the Business Services and that residual personal information may continue to reside in Samsung’s records and archives for some time, in compliance with applicable law, but Samsung will not use that information for commercial purposes. You understand that, despite your request for deletion, Samsung reserves the right to keep your personal information, or a relevant part of it, in line with our data retention policy and applicable laws, if Samsung has suspended, limited, or terminated your access to the website for violating the Samsung Terms of Service, when necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Samsung, or any of our respective affiliates, business partners, employees, or customers.

How We Protect Personal Information

We maintain appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information we obtain through the Service against accidental, unlawful, or unauthorised destruction, interference, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use. Samsung also maintains reasonable procedures to help ensure that such data is reliable for its intended use and is accurate, complete, and current.
